# Sentiment Analysis Of Elon Musk's Tweets : The Effect On Tesla's Stocks
  
## Dataset

> The datasets used in this analysis were pulled from Twitter API and Yahoo Finance Stocks data with two bots built specifically for this project.  
You can check out 'twitter_bot.py' and 'tesla_stocks_bot.py'.

## Project Overview:
> This is a research stemming from financial analysis to investigate if there's a correlation between any company owner's tweets; be it positive or negative, 
and the effect on their company's stocks. In this case, we're using Elon Musk and his Tesla company from 2022-07-25 to 2022-07-31 as our use case.

> The research covers 
> - building API data retrieval bots, 
> - using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to clean and process the tweets 
> - using NLP libraries and bag of words to analyze the sentiment of each tweet
> - analysis and visualization of available data   

For the analysis to be more reasonable in checking the effect of tweets against stocks, the stocks data used were for exactly 10 minutes after Elon made the 
tweets. Thereby making the research more effective by allowing for time for changes in the stocks.
